What is Quill? Quill is a free, open source WYSIWYG editor built for the modern web. With its modular architecture and expressive API, it is completely customizable to fit any need.

## Installation

The package is only available trough composer:

```sh
composer require nadar/quill-delta-parser
```

## Usage

```php
use nadar\quill\Lexer;

$lexer = new Lexer($json);

// echoing the html for the given json ops.
echo $lexer->render();
```

Where `$json` is the ops json array from quill, for example:

```json
{
  "ops": [
    {
      "insert": "Hello"
    },
    {
      "attributes": {
        "header": 1
      },
      "insert": "\n"
    },
    {
      "insert": "\nThis is the php quill "
    },
    {
      "attributes": {
        "bold": true
      },
      "insert": "parser"
    },
    {
      "insert": "!\n"
    }
  ]
}
```

This would render the following HTML:

```html
<h1>Hello</h1>
<p>THis is the php quill <strong>parsers</strong>!</p>
```
